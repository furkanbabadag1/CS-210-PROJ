# CS-210 Project: Rain and Work Patterns Analysis

## Motivation

Hello, I’m Furkan Emre Babadag, and this is my CS-210 project. The idea for this project stems from a question that came to my mind last summer. During the summer, I participated in the Work and Travel program in the USA, where I worked as a barista in a coffee shop and also held a retail job as a second position. 

My managers often mentioned that rainy weather increased foot traffic in coffee and clothing shops because people tended to avoid the beach and look for indoor activities instead. This led to supposedly me getting more shifts on rainy weeks. By the end of the summer, I was curious to see if this pattern held true—did I actually work more hours during rainy periods? However, I never had the time to investigate this.

With this project, I aim to analyze this hypothesis using data from my personal records and weather data. I hope to uncover insights into human behavioral patterns and assess how closely my work hours were tied to rainy weather.

## Dataset

For this analysis, I will use the following data sources:

### 1. Paychecks
- **Source:** Data from Paylocity, a work organization app.
- **Details:** Weekly paycheck records that include:
  - Total earnings.
  - Total hours worked.
  - Amounts taxed.
  

### 3. Weather Data
- **Source:** Historical weather reports from local weather channels.
- **Details:** Data will include a binary classification for each day (e.g., "Rainy" or "Not Rainy") for three distinct categories to assess correlations with working hours.
- **Categories:** The data will have rain information, temperature and number of cloudy days.

This dataset will allow me to analyze the relationship between weather conditions (rainy vs. non-rainy days etc.) and my working patterns during the summer.


## Plan

### Week 1-2: Data Collection and Exploration
- Extract data from Paylocity.
- Gather historical weather data for the relevant period.
- Explore the datasets to understand their structure and clean them for analysis.

### Week 3-4: Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyze the correlation between work hours and weather conditions.
- Visualize the data using charts and graphs to clearly present findings.

### Last Week: Finalization
- Compile the results into a final report.
- Refine and document the codebase.

## Project Idea

Through this project, I aim to answer a fun trivia question about my summer work experience: **Did weather conditions really increase the hours I worked? What tpe of correlation is there?** By investigating this using my personal data, I also hope to explore human behavioral patterns in response to weather changes. This project is both personal and scientific, combining curiosity with data analysis to arrive at a meaningful conclusion.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of the project, I expect to:
1. Identify whether there is a significant correlation between rainy weather and the hours I worked.
2. Does other type of weather situations affect humans decisions as well?
3. Do people go to coffee and clothing shops more if they can't go to beach in summer?
4. Present findings visually through well-designed charts.
5. Share the code and methodology for others to replicate or learn from.
